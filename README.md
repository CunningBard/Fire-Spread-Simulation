# Fire-Spread-Simulation
A simulation about fire spreading, built on rust.

# Note: you're trying to access **THE LATEST BRANCH**, I suggest you looking at main branch

## Rules
The Simulation will randomly burn 1 tree, the tree will be burning for
5 turns, and with each turn, there is a 30% chance the tree will burn
a surrounding tree.

you can modify the values inside the file, so you can change the burn
turn to 20 or the chance of burning other.

## How to run?
